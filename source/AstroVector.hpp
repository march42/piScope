	/*	type of vector	(see Vector3D.hpp)
	**	3DONLY defines a vector which timestamp is unneeded or not changing
	**	ECEF (earth centered, earth fixed) origin at center of mass of the earth X/Y axis lying on equatorial plane
	**		X axis from lon=180 (antipodal meridian) for negative values to lon=0 (prime meridian) for positive values
	**		Y axis from lon=90W for negative values to lon=90E for positive values
	**		Z axis on rotation axis of earth, negative values pointing south and positive values north
	**	LATLON are geo coordinates, fixed on Earth's mean surface
	**		X = latitude (degrees North), Y = longitude (degrees East), Z = heights above mean sea level
	**	LocalENU (east, north, up) centered/fixed on a local tangent/geodetic plane, east=x, north=y, up=z
	**	LocalNED (north, east, down) centered/fixed on a local tangent/geodetic plane, north=x', east=y', down=z'
	**	J2000 (ECI) fixed on Earth's Mean Equator and Equinox at 12:00 Terrestrial Time on 1 January 2000
	**		X axis aligned with mean equinox, Y axis 90Â° east on celestial equator, Z axis aligned with celestial pole
